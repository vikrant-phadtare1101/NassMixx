## Constructor




## Events
### Approval(address,address,uint256)


**Execution cost**: No bound available


Params:

1. **owner** *of type `address`*
2. **spender** *of type `address`*
3. **value** *of type `uint256`*

--- 
### Transfer(address,address,uint256)


**Execution cost**: No bound available


Params:

1. **from** *of type `address`*
2. **to** *of type `address`*
3. **value** *of type `uint256`*


## Methods
### decreaseApproval(address,uint256)
>
> Decrease the amount of tokens that an owner allowed to a spender. approve should be called when allowed[_spender] == 0. To decrement allowed value is better to use this function to avoid 2 calls (and wait until the first transaction is mined) From MonolithDAO Token.sol


**Execution cost**: No bound available


Params:

1. **_spender** *of type `address`*

    > The address which will spend the funds.

2. **_subtractedValue** *of type `uint256`*

    > The amount of tokens to decrease the allowance by.


Returns:


1. **output_0** *of type `bool`*

--- 
### allowance(address,address)
>
> Function to check the amount of tokens that an owner allowed to a spender.


**Execution cost**: less than 950 gas

**Attributes**: constant


Params:

1. **_owner** *of type `address`*

    > address The address which owns the funds.

2. **_spender** *of type `address`*

    > address The address which will spend the funds.


Returns:

> A uint256 specifying the amount of tokens still available for the spender.

1. **output_0** *of type `uint256`*

### INITIAL_SUPPLY()


**Execution cost**: less than 272 gas

**Attributes**: constant



Returns:


1. **output_0** *of type `uint256`*

--- 
### approve(address,uint256)
>
> Approve the passed address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of msg.sender. Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729


**Execution cost**: less than 22354 gas


Params:

1. **_spender** *of type `address`*

2. **_value** *of type `uint256`*

    > The amount of tokens to be spent.


Returns:


1. **output_0** *of type `bool`*

**Attributes**: constant


Params:

Returns:

> An uint256 representing the amount owned by the passed address.

--- 
### increaseApproval(address,uint256)
>
> Increase the amount of tokens that an owner allowed to a spender. approve should be called when allowed[_spender] == 0. To increment allowed value is better to use this function to avoid 2 calls (and wait until the first transaction is mined) From MonolithDAO Token.sol
